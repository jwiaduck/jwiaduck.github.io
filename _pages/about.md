I am currently a senior studying Computer Science Engineering at the University of Michigan College of Engineering.
My current interests lie in Affective Machine Learning, Software Engineering, and Security.
I'd love to talk about how Affective Machine Learning can be applied to Speech Emotion Recognition and Software Engineering!

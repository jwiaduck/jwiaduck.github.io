I am a senior studying Computer Science Engineering at the University of Michigan.

When I'm not at the computer, you might find me listening to music, exploring local food and drink establishments with friends, or spending time outdoors. I love to learn about and try new things, and frequently fall trap to the Wikipedia rabbit hole.

I hope to use this site as a type of [notes to my future self](https://vaneyckt.io/). 

Feel free to email me at the link on the side or at: jwiaduck+github AT umich DOT edu.

Some things I'm interested in are listed below!

Update March 17:
I am currently taking an Affective Machine Learning and Software Engineering course, which I find very interesting and would like to explore more! 
I'd love to talk about how Affective Machine Learning can be applied to Speech Emotion Recognition and Software Engineering!

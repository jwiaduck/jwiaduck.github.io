I am a senior studying Computer Science Engineering at the University of Michigan College of Engineering.

My current interests lie in Affective Machine Learning, Software Engineering, and Security.
I'd love to talk about how Affective Machine Learning can be applied to Speech Emotion Recognition and Software Engineering!

When I'm not coding, you might find me listening to music, exploring local food and drink establishments with friends, or spending time outdoors.

I hope to use this website as both a little bit of a blog and a little bit of a portfolio.
